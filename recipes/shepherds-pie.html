    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Celtic classic is now easier and cheesier than ever! Beef, taters,
        veggies, and gravy can certainly shine on their own but once you've given 
        your pie the Philadelphia treatment you'll be screaming, "ADRIAN!!!" every
        time you hear The Chieftains.
